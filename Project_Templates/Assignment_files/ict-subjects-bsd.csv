BTE620,"Law, Ethics and Social Responsibility","This course examines fundamental issues concerning the nature of legal and moral responsibility. What is it to be responsible, i.e. for one's actions? The concept of responsibility is prima facie a kind of liability to the welfare or interests of others. Thus, if one's act is considered ""good,"" then it is deserving of the appropriate praise or reward; an ""evil"" act, on the other hand, is subject to the required blame, censure, or (if necessary) punishment. Actions, however, can be evaluated in moral and/or legal terms. We may now ask: what is the difference between moral and legal responsibility (for one's actions)? What is the justification of punishment? Similarly, moral blame is a form of punishment; but under what conditions is it reasonable to morally condemn irresponsible acts? In order to properly address these questions, we must first explore their foundation: the nature of law in relation to morality. Is law (necessarily) conditioned by moral principles or only contingently moral, i.e. a ""social fact""? Thus, our understanding of moral and legal responsibility turns on our conceptions of morality and law.",Current,https://scs.senecac.on.ca/course/bte620
